# extension-changer
A Py script that will find and change extensions should you need it to.

Make sure to replace '/path/to/folder' with the actual path of the folder where your files are located. This script will iterate over all the files in the folder and rename any file with the extension "existing extention* to "new extentions". The old and new filenames will be printed as each file is renamed.

Please exercise caution when using this script and make sure to backup your files before running it, as renaming files can be irreversible.

You will need to run this in Command Prompt for windows. So Python will need to be installed in order to run it. Just change directory to the location of the script and run "python changedoc.py"
